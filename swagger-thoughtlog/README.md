Saving anything and everything that we think daily. It can be simple, stupid or shy thing. Helps maintain all those wonderful thoughts which may be useful :)


## Installation

1. Install all the node dependencies.

```sh
$ npm install

```

2. Run the app with the following command.

```sh
$ swagger project start
```

3. You can start creating new endpoints with the following setup.
  
   i. Restart the swagger project in mock mode as
      ```
      $ swagger project start -m
      ```
      
   ii. In another terminal window
      ```
      $ swagger project edit
      ```
 
 Step 3 ensures that we are building the Swagger mocks even before we implement the business logic which is kinda cool :D
